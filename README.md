Welcome to the End-to-End Medical Chatbot using Llama3 project! This project showcases a comprehensive medical chatbot built using advanced technologies to assist users with medical inquiries, manage appointments, and retrieve hospital information. It also includes a Voice Assistant for voice interaction and features an appointment booking system.

## üìã Project Overview
This chatbot leverages the power of the Llama3 model from Hugging Face to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. It integrates with Pinecone for vector database operations, MongoDB for appointment booking, and Neo4j for managing and retrieving hospital-related data. Developed using Flask, it offers a seamless and interactive web interface.

## üéØ Features
 - üß† LLM-Powered Responses: The chatbot uses an advanced language model to understand and respond to user queries.
 - üé§ Voice Input: Interact with the bot using your voice for a more accessible experience.
- üè• Hospital Data Retrieval: Retrieve detailed information about hospital services, doctors, and contact details stored in a Neo4j graph database.
- ‚ö° Real-Time Responses: Get instant answers to your questions without delay.
- üí¨ Interactive UI: Enjoy a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
- üìÖ Appointment Booking: Users can book medical appointments, which are stored in MongoDB.

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amber-bagchi/Medical-Chatbot.git
```

```bash
cd End-to-End-Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama3
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate a Conda Environment
Create a Conda environment with Python 3.8:

```bash
conda create -n mchatbot python=3.8 -y
```
```bash
conda activate mchatbot
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Requirements
Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your credentials:

```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your_neo4j_instance_uri
NEO4J_USER=your_neo4j_username
NEO4J_PASS=your_neo4j_password
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate and Initialize the Hugging Face Llama Model
#### - Retrieve API Key: Ensure your Hugging Face API key is stored in your environment variables.
#### - Authenticate with Hugging Face: Use the login(KEY) function to authenticate your session.
#### - Initialize the Language Model: Configure the Llama model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct with a temperature setting of 0.5.

  
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up MongoDB for Appointment Booking
Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible. The application uses MongoDB to store appointment details.
